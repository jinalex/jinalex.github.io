Three years ago, Industry 4.0 (the fourth industrial revolution) has become a new and increasingly popular topic in Europe. This term originally coined in Germany describes the new wave of computerization in manufacturing with the onset of cloud computing and connected machines. Nowadays, the manufacturing world has not only adopted the Industry 4.0 mindset but we as citizens in our increasingly connected world have also witnessed the impact resulting from millions of smart devices being introduced to the physical world around us. With the reduction of manufacturing costs and new technology developed in the age of Industry 4.0, we now have smart phones, thermostats, cars, drones, and even smart devices strapped to our bodies thanks to this new manufacturing mindset.

As the largest contributor in the global manufacturing industry, China has played an irreplaceable role in the past 15 years after its entry into World Trade Organization. The Western world has become accustomed to going to China as their #1 Original Electronic Manufacturing partner. Since then Shenzhen, the epicentre of electronics manufacturing, has tremendously driven its exports, at the same time Shenzhen has also gained the dubious reputation as the most capable “copycat” city in the world. Moreover, the stereotype of poor quality when it comes to 'Made in China' certainly does not help. But now with the rise of consumer purchasing power in the domestic Chinese market, manufacturers are increasingly committed to satisfying the appetite for high value goods rather than cutting costs. Rising labour wages have also forced the hand of Chinese manufacturing. It is evident that China is losing its lead as a source of low cost labour year after year. This signals that China must look for an alternative source of differentiation on the global stage. A world-class factory floor is not good enough. This begs the question, what can China do now to stand out in the global market? The answer lies with innovation.

China's innovation is now being reshaped by both consumer demand and government advocacy. In 2012, 68 percent of China’s urban consumers earned 60,000 to 229,000 RMB ($9,000 to $34,000 USD) a year. Only 4 percent of urban Chinese households were within this range in the year 2000. This growing middle class have generated demand for premium products such as smartphones. It's no coincidence that brands such as Samsung and Apple are losing market share to Oppo, XiaoMi, and Huawei who are not only competitive in terms of price but also in terms of their unique product features.

Government policies have also propelled manufacturing. China Manufacturing 2025, akin to Germany’s advocacy of Industry 4.0, is one of the more prominent government efforts which uses subsidies, mandates, and incentives to encourage manufacturers to upgrade their infrastructure. Research and development in China has hit a new high as the Gross Expenditure on Research and Development has risen from 0.6% of GDP in 1996 to 1.98% of GDP in 2012 ($150 billion USD). Now there's an ever increasing number of original products and inventions being developed in China such as Ehang186, the first passenger drone and graphene aerogel, the world's lightest material.

This change in Government attitude towards innovation comes from the top. Last year, China’s Premier Li Keqiang announced the success of the whole country lies with “Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation”. As a promoter of innovation and entrepreneurship, Premier Li has also taken on a special title of “Maker Li” for himself and is eager to share his wisdom and mentor the next cohort of entrepreneurs. Through these efforts it's evident that China is determined to revolutionize the country's economy through entrepreneurial spirit and innovation.

Everyday in China millions of entrepreneurial minds are working to launch competitive products into the consumer market. The aim is to not only succeed in the fierce domestic market but also in the global market. With a large amount of overseas returnees coming back to China to start their company, Chinese makers have the global knowledge and expertise of building innovative products that have communicable value to customers worldwide. The popularization of social media and new approaches such as crowdfunding enable Chinese makers to create for the global market faster and in a way that has never been simpler. With the added support of domestic demand and government policy, China is ready to produce innovative products for a global audience.

Today China is poised to take a leadership role in this new era of manufacturing and innovation with unparalleled supply chain infrastructure, unprecedented government advocacy, and most importantly a younger generation of makers who breathe the entrepreneurial spirit.
